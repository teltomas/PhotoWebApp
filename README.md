# PhotoWebApp in Flask 

Web App to publish a photo portfolio.

This web page was created in Flask on behalf of a CS50x end project.

From the beginning, I wanted to do for this project something that would have some meaning to me. Considering that I do photography as a hobby, my decision ended up on creating a Web-Based app in Flask with which I, and other photographers from my community, would be able to display our work.

Considering that the app would not be something just for me, it would be necessary to have a management area with a good UI so that other photographers would be able to change the aspect of the page and update or modify the photo galleries and page content to their desire.

With that in mind, this web app was born.

Right now, any information presented in this page was randomly generated and does not represent the reality.

Most of the build and design was done by my own ideas and creation, although with some exceptions like the following ones:
