# PhotoWebApp in Flask 

Web App to publish a photo portfolio.

This web page was created in Flask on behalf of a CS50x end project.

From the beginning I wanted to do for this project something that would have some meaning to me. Considering that I do photography as a hobbie, my decision ended up on creating a Web Based app in Flask where me, and other photographers from my comunity, would be able to display our work.

Considering that the app would not being something just for me, it would be necessary to have a management area with a good UI so that other photographers would be able to change the aspect of the page and update or modify the photo galleries and page content to their desire.

With that in mind, this web app was born.
